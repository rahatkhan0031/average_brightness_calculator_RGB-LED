# ðŸ’¡ Average Brightness Calculator with Arduino

This project reads brightness values from a light sensor, calculates the average over time, and outputs the result via the Serial Monitor.

---

## ðŸ›  Components
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- Light sensor (e.g., photoresistor or photodiode)
- Resistors (for voltage divider if using LDR)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

---

## ðŸ’¡ Functionality
- Reads brightness values periodically from an analog input.
- Calculates the average brightness over a set of readings.
- Displays the average value in the Serial Monitor.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `sketch_calculate_Average_Brightness.ino` â€” Arduino sketch.

---

## â–¶ How to Run
1. Connect your light sensor to an analog pin (e.g., `A0`) using a voltage divider.
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload it to your Arduino board.
4. Open the Serial Monitor at the configured baud rate (default: **9600**).
5. Observe live average brightness values.
